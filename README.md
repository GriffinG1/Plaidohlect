# Plaidohlect
A Discord server bot by T3CHNOLOG1C. Designed heavily around the Shack Secret Service Discord.
Based off of [Kurisu](https://github.com/916253/Kurisu), the Nintendo Homebrew Discord server bot by 916253 and ihaveamac/ihaveahax.

Although it is open source, this bot is not really designed to be used in other setups at the moment, the source is mainly just available for those interested.

## Requirements:
* Python 3.5 or above
* [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py). Be sure to use the latest version for best results.
