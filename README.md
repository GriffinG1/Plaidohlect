# Plaidohlect
A Discord server bot by T3CHNOLOG1C, with help from Sentry, Ali365Dash and Hydraxis. Designed heavily around the Shack Secret Service Discord.
Based off of [Kurisu](https://github.com/916253/Kurisu), the Nintendo Homebrew Discord server bot by 916253 and ihaveamac/ihaveahax.

Although it is open source, this bot is not really designed to be used in other setups at the moment, the source is mainly just available for those interested.

## What to run:
`run.sh` to run the whole bot, music bot included.

`run.py` to run the bot, but without the music bot.

## Requirements:

* Python 3.5 or above
* `pip install -r requirements.txt`
